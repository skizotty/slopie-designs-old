						With extensive knowledge in analytics, Javascript, and Application Arcitecture, I am able to create the best solution for your needs. Whether your business be a small business, or a large grossing, multiple employee business, I have the solution.
					</p><p>
						Pricing can be determined based upon the purpose of your website, your company size as well as the scale of what you would need done. Estimates are free to feel free to shoot me an email and ask questions. You can find my email under the <a href='/contact.htm'>contact</a> tab.
					</p><p>
						With any website that I do build and provide to you, you will get unlimited support. I stand behind my creations so if something does go wrong then I will be there to fix it. This is because I believe that once we become partners, we enter into a business relationship and that is something that needs to be nurtured. After established our relationship can grown into something that will last many years and mutually benefit both of us.
					</p><p>
						Side Note: I do of course support our military, so anyone who has a VA card will be given a discount!
